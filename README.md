# MemeusMachinus
The Official Bot for [NFreak's Stream Discord Server](https://discord.nfreak.tv), providing basic quality of life improvements to the server.

Based off of StickBot, the CustomGCC Discord bot, which itself is a fork of Gifkin, the Icons: Combat Arena discord bot.

## How does it work?
MemeusMachinus is a Discord Bot powered by [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). The Bot is being regularly maintained and updated to meet the needs of the growing community, and supports things like automatic role distribution, removal of messages with harmful content, server usage information, and more. If you have suggestions for what the bot should do, let the Mod team know!

## Features
* Server info (Can tell you how many members have joined the server, and how many are online)
* Message analytics (Can tell you who are the most frequent posters in a given channel)
* Dynamic Text Commands (Any mod can create a command that will return text that is available to all users)
* Channel cleanup
* Spam filtering
* and much more!

## Usage
MemeusMachinus is very particularly tailored to use within NFreak's server, but with a bit of work, you can bring it to your own server!

/src/config.ts will run upon running the bot, and will create the files you'll need to get it up and running. Populate these with the appropriate information and you'll be all set.

## Credits
MemeusMachinus was forked from Gifkin, and reworked and maintained by Tyler "NFreak" Morrow.

Gifkin was originally written by Adam "WaveParadigm" Gincel, who is a member of the Mod team on the Icons Discord Server.
